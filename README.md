# MineController
A REST API framework for Java designed to match ASP.NET's syntax.

# What is MineController?
MineController is an attempt at bringing REST Controllers' syntax from ASP.NET over to Java and Kotlin. Simply define your controller functions with the appropriate http requests and routing, and the framework will take care of the rest.

Currently, MineController uses Jetty for the http server. Future plans may include moving to more lightweight web servers.

# Why is it named MINEController?
The need of a convenient REST API framework came to me when I was developing some Minecraft REST API endpoints, and wanted a more convenient way to create the endpoints instead of handling http requests by myself.
